<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<section>
<strong>What is a yurt?</strong>
      <p> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, 
 a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
      </p>
</section>
<section>
  <strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong>
       <p> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired
stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with 
hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
       </p>

<section>
  <strong>What should I bring?</strong>
       <p> Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing 
weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and 
a sense of adventure!
